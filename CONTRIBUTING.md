# Ult Foundation Contributor's Guide

## Reporting issues

Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug. See [SSCCE](http://www.sscce.org/) for guidance. Also include browser or Node.js version, OS and other related software's versions when applicable.

## Making pull requests

If you are going to edit or create JavaScript files, please follow the [UltStyle.js guidelines](https://github.com/UltFoundation/UltStyle.js/blob/master/README.md).

Fork the repository you want to contribute to, clone it locally and create a branch for your proposed bug fix or new feature. Avoid working directly on the master branch.

Implement your bug fix or feature, write tests to cover it (provided the repository has a test suite) and make sure all tests are passing. Then commit your changes, push your bug fix/feature branch to the origin (your forked repo) and open a pull request to the upstream (the repository you originally forked)'s master branch.
